## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I first started with the content of the website by writing the HTML. After I was finished with the content I styled the site, starting at the header and working my way down. Once the styles were complete, I added media queries so that the site looks great at all resolutions. After that, I added a dropdown menu to the header to save space using CSS and simple JS.

## Optimizations
The main problem with this site is the fact that the nav is not fixed to the top of the viewport. In future iterations, I would write JavaScript that fixes the header to the top of the screen when the user scrolls down.

## Lessons Learned:

Building this website enhanced my understanding of modern web development practices such as implementing responsive design principles. I gained valuable experience in utilizing CSS and JavaScript to create a great user experience. Additionally, this project underscored the importance of thorough testing and cross-browser compatibility to ensure a consistent interface for all users.
